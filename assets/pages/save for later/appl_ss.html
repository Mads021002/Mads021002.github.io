    <h2>Hi SpringSummer!</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="appl-content">
    <p>
        Dear SpringSummer,
        <br><br>
        I am a 21 year old boy from Aarhus, living in Copenhagen, who wishes to use my skills at a small and agile team like yours.
        <br><br>
        In my previous job at a tech startup focused on ecommerce stores, I not only gained insight into, but actively worked with how ecommerce stores work and operate. In addition, I actively worked with UX, user research and creating product specifications to understand how our software was perceived and how it could work better.
        <br>
        In addition, I will be starting at <a href="https://itu.dk/Uddannelser/Bacheloruddannelser/Softwareudvikling" target="_blank">ITU</a> in September to study software development, where April and May will be spent studying Maths A from 08:30-11:45.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    But to be honest, I'm just really eager to learn.
<br>
I just wish for three simple things: to create something new, to be creative, to learn - preferably in programming and a little design, which is why I'm writing to you.
<br><br>
I'm still very unskilled and I generally know very little, but on the other hand, I can promise a fire, lightning and thunder of commitment on my part. I am therefore also more than willing to work for free for the first month, so you can take a look at me and assess whether it makes sense for you to continue.
<br>
I have no doubt that my skills can be utilised to help build e-commerce sites, websites or apps - I have experience in all three areas from my time at Custimy and Make Influence.

Two weeks ago I had never written any code that wasn't part of a tutorial before, but I learnt how to code a website from scratch, create a design, host the site among others. 
<br>
By the way, you can click around the site to read more about me.
<br><br>
So, could you use a good dose of 'jysk' young gun, with lots of drive and a large dose of commitment? Then don't hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an email, I'm up for a coffee no matter what.
<br>
Phone: +45 26 84 13 85

Mail: damgaard.magnussen@gmail.com
<br><br>
I look forward to hearing from you.
<br><br>
Best regards,
<br><br>
